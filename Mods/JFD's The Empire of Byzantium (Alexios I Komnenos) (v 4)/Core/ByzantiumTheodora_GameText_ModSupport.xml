			<Text>The unique Stoudion is Theodora's Byzantium's replacement for the Monastery, however, it contains a slot for a Great Work of Art. It benefits your Missionaries by granting then an additional [ICON_MOVES] Movement and removing their Sight Penalty when they are born. Ensure that you build Stoudions at your centres for religious propagation.</Text>
