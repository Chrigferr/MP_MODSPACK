			<Text>The Longboat is an early naval unit unique to Denmark, replacing the Galleass. Unlike the Galleass, the Longboat is available at Optics and, though it is slightly weaker, it confers the Coastal Raider promotion to Land Units within two tiles, benefiting them when attacking Cities. It also may cross oceans immediately, allowing it to scout the waters long before other civilizations.</Text>

			<Text>Longboats (or Longships) were sea vessels made and used by the Vikings from the Nordic countries for trade, commerce, exploration, and warfare during the Viking Age. The longship is characterized as a graceful, long, narrow, light, wooden boat with a shallow-draft hull designed for speed. The ship's shallow draft allowed navigation in waters only one metre deep and permitted beach landings. Longships were fitted with oars along almost the entire length of the boat itself. Later versions sported a rectangular sail on a single mast which was used to replace or augment the effort of the rowers.</Text>
