			<Text>The Vandals were an East Germanic tribe, their original homeland in Scandinavia. The Vandals crossed the Baltic into Poland at some point in the 2nd Century BC. By 406 AD, the Vandals had reached the Rhine. Attempting to cross it, they met fierce resistance from the Franks, who had settled the Romanized regions of northern Gaul. The Vandals decisively defeated the Frankish army, and then proceeded to plunder their way southward. After sacking Frankish and Roman cities, they reached and crossed the Pyrenees in 409 AD and marched into Iberia.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Under pressure from the Visigoths there, Genseric led the Vandals across the straits into North Africa in 429. There Genseric established a Vandal kingdom in 435 when a treaty with Rome gave them control of the province of Numidia. Genseric broke the treaty in 439 and seized Carthage, along with its extensive shipyards and fleet. Over the next decade, along with unrelenting piracy and raids against the Romans and Byzantines, the Vandals overran Sardinia, Sicily, Corsica and the Balearic Islands.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With the death of Attila, the Roman emperor felt free to end the Vandal incursions and sought to return the lost lands to Rome through his daughter's marriage to Genseric's son. However, through a convoluted series of events and distrust, the effort ended in 455 AD with the landing of a Vandal army in Italy and its capture of Rome.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The sack of Rome proved the highpoint of Vandal power. The death of Genseric in 477, religious tensions, revolts in former Roman provinces, and lack of trade brought a slow decline. In a final costly war, the Byzantine Belisarius crushed the Vandal armies, killed the Vandal general Tzazo and captured most of the Vandal cities. In 534 AD Gelimer, the last Vandal king, surrendered Carthage to the Roman conquerors, ending the Vandal reign forever.</Text>

For fifty years you led your people as their greatest King; forging from the crumbling remains of the Roman Empire a Kingdom on the edge of Northern Africa. With a formidable and unmatched naval might, the Vandal Kingdom quickly seized the throne of the Mediterranean, and in 455 AD joined the other barbarian Kingdoms in their great feast upon the carcass of Rome.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]O' fearsome Lord, great empires bloated with wealth lie upon the horizons and your people thirst for a leader with the terrible might to drain those empires of their golden blood. Can you raise a mighty fleet to wrest control of the seas? Can you make once great empires tremble in fear of your power? Can you build a civilization that will stand the test of time?</Text>

			<Text>The Alans were a tribe who started out in Eastern Europe, but like the Vandals, slowly moved to North Africaâ€™s shores. They started out with kingdoms around the Danube and the north Caucasus, and fervently remained tribal for their history. The Alans contented themselves to raiding other major empires, such as the Parthians, before their eventual shift to the Germanic homelands. When the Huns defeated the Goths, the Alans, along with other Germanic tribes, migrated across the Rhine to the Mediterranean shores of the crumbling Roman Empire. Along with the Vandals, the Alans settled in North Africa, and co-operated with them in order to see Rome destroyed. Noted for their conquests, the Alans were regarded as superb cavalrymen, given their original Nomadic settlement. Interestingly, a lot of Alans stayed in the Caucasus after the migrations, and continued to remain independent up until the Mongol Conquests. The Alans still have settlements that are in use all over Europe, such as Iasi, one of the oldest and largest cities in Romania. </Text>
