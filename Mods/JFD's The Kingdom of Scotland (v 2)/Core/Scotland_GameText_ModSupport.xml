			<Text>It has been said many times that the Scottish education system is one of the best in the world - the author having experienced a fair bit of it - and regardless of whether this is true or not, it has certainly played a vital role in Scottish history. Burke and Hare, the infamous body snatchers of Edinburgh, sold the bodies on to a local medical school. Today, education is a devolved power in Scotland, meaning that the Scottish government exercises total authority over the curriculum. Given that people in the EU (though not in the UK, for some strange reason) do not pay tuition fees for attending universities and colleges in Scotland, a lot of people have decided to come to Scotland to study. The Royal Society of Edinburgh is among one of the most prominent places for the learned, given its history of success - it has been noted for its advancement in philosophy, medicines, sciences, and the arts, making it, among other places like it within Scotland, part of the country’s intellectual greatness.</Text>
