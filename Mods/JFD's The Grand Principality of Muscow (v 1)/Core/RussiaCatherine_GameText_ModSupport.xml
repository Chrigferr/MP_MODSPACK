			<Text>The Smolny Institute is a Palladian edifice in St Petersburg that has played a major part in the history of Russia. The building was commissioned from Giacomo Quarenghi by the Society for Education of Noble Maidens and constructed in 1806â€“08 to house the Smolny Institute for Noble Maidens, established at the urging of Ivan Betskoy and in accordance with a decree of Catherine II (the Great) in 1764, borrowing its name from the nearby Smolny Convent. The Smolny was Russia's first educational establishment for women and continued to function under the personal patronage of the Russian Emperors until just before the 1917 revolution.</Text>
