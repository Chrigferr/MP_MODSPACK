It was built from 1555â€“61 on orders from Ivan the Terrible and commemorates the capture of Kazan and Astrakhan. A world famous landmark, it has been the hub of growth since the 14th century and was the tallest building in the city until the completion of the Ivan the Great Bell Tower in 1600.</Text>
