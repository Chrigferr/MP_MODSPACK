				The Parliament is divided and unable to form a working cabinet. This is not the first situation of that sort, but this time the risk of civil disorder is high. It is clear that our country with its liberal constitution will not function properly if this situation is allowed to go on. We must take action, and assume direct and personal control of the course of action of our politics.[NEWLINE]

				A team of leading mathematicians have been employed by our military forces with the task of deciphering the secret code used by one of our neighbours’ army. The machine which is responsible for encrypting messages happens to have a civilian variant, a unit of which was duly obtained by a fake company run by our intelligence. After months of work, the team presented us with the results - the algorithm behind the code. Cracking the code of a military variant of the machine is only a matter of time.[NEWLINE]
