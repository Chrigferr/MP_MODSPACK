In addition, the Krepost reduces the Culture cost of acquiring new Tiles, based upon its distance from the [ICON_STRENGTH] Capital. It also causes enemy units to expend 1 extra movement if they move through a tile worked by a city with a Krepost. It's quite worthwhile to construct these useful buildings in all Russian cities, but especially in cities on the civilization's frontiers; far from your capital.
