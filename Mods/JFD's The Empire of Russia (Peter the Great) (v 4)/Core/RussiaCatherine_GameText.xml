			<Text>Banya or banja can refer to a number of types of steam baths popular in Eastern Europe. In Russia, it refers to a particular local type of sauna. A mention of the banya is found in the Radzivill Chronicle in the story of Princess Olga's revenge for the murder of her husband, Prince Igor, by the Slavic tribe of Drevlians in 945 AD. The leader of the Drevlians had hopes of marrying the widow Olga and sent messengers to discuss the idea. "When the Drevlians arrived, Olga commanded that a bath should be made ready for them and said, 'Wash yourselves and come to me.' The bath-house was heated and the unsuspecting Drevlians entered and began to wash themselves. [Olga's] men closed the bath-house behind them and Olga gave orders to set it on fire from the doors, so that the Drevlians were all burned to death."</Text>

It also increases a city's [ICON_PRODUCTION] Production by 10% for every different type of improved Strategic Resource in the area. However, it takes slightly longer to be constructed than the Garden, and it still can only be built in a city next to a River or Lake.</Text>
