				A 13th century manuscript created by Dvur Králové to espouse the greatness of Bohemian identity has turned out to be a forgery. Nonetheless, it has sparked interest in the Czech language, since eroded by the influences of German, and a swelling of national pride has been instilled in the people. It would be a perfect opportunity to revive our ancient language.[NEWLINE]
