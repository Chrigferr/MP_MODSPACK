			<Text>Hungary was an important medieval kingdom settled by the Uralic Magyar people in the 9th century AD. During the Middle Ages, Hungary was a crucial piece of Christian Europe's defense against Ottoman incursion. The kingdom collapsed in the 16th century but Hungary persisted as an important battleground between Christian Europe and Muslim invaders. Hungary has remained relevant as a part of the Austro-Hungarian empire in the 1800s, the Soviet Bloc during the Cold War, and the European Union since.</Text>

			<Text>Like many places of human settlement, the area now known as Hungary features two major rivers, the Danube and the Tisza. The Danube is a key artery for most of Central Europe, and flows through the Hungarian capital, Budapest. Located in the Carpathian basin, Hungary is not particularly resoruce-rich, but it contains plenty of fertile land to support human settlement. Its location as a border between the Balkan Peninsula (and Turkey) and the rest of northern and western Europe has defined its role throughout history.</Text>

			<Text>Before the arrival of the Hungarians, many empires controlled or occupied the Carpathian basin. It was part of the Roman empire beginning in 9 BC, and a small settlement was built, the remains of which are part of the city of Budapest. After the Romans came the Huns, which, despite their name, are believed to be unrelated to the Hungarians. After the fall of Rome, the Goths, Lombards and other so-called barbarians took control. Slavs, Avars, and Franks also played a role in shaping the Carpathian up until the arrival of the Hungarians.</Text>

			<Text>Retreating after being attacked by the Bulgarians and the Pechenegs, the Hungarians migrated to the Carpathian Basin around 895. The Hungarians first had appeared in history as a Uralic people, but the coalition between their two assailants drove the Magyars (a term largely synonymous with Hungarian) to their current lands.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The conquest of the Carpathian was not instantaneous.  The Hungarians first conquered the lands east of the Danube but the lands to the west – the former Roman province of Pannonia – took a few years longer. The Magyars were raiders – in 899 and 900, they ventured into Italy, plundering lands until they were halted by the Venetians.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Moravia, the polity that controlled these areas, ceased to exist soon after the year 900. The exact circumstances of the completion of the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin is unclear. However, the nation and state known as Hungary would exist there from this point onwards.</Text>

			<Text>After their conquests, the Hungarian people remained afraid of their neighbors to the east, the Pechenegs, feeling they were outnumbered. Large swathes of the region were left uninhabitated, concentrating the population for defensive purposes. Instead of fighting the Pecehengs, they turned westward, raiding into Western Europe. Swabia, the West Frankish marches, Bavaria and Saxony were all targets of the Hungarians, as was the Byzantine Empire. Defeat at the hand of the Franks at the Battle of Lechfeld in 955 ended their incursions westward, while defeat by the Byzantines at Arkadopolis in 970 ended their exploits there.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]These invasions occurred during a time where raiding was widespread throughout Europe – Muslims, Vikings and Hungarians were all wreaking havoc across Western Europe. Like with the Vikings, many of the Hungarian raiders were gradually assimilated into European civilization. After these defeats, the Hungarians abandoned raiding and nomadism for a more sedentary lifestyle in Central Europe.</Text>

			<Text>The Arpad dynasty participated in the conquest of the Carpathian, and ruled the Hungarians afterward. Geza was the first to initiate Hungarian contact with Christianity, while his son Stephen I became the first King of Hungary after doing battle with pagan forces led by his uncle. He was crowned in 1000 or 1001 with the blessing of the Pope, with Hungary becoming an Apostolic Kingdom.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After Stephen consolidated his power, he moved to Christianize and Westernize Hungary, establishing feudalism and Latin as the official language. Hungary grew in power and prestige. Another Arpad king, Bela III, was notably more wealthy than the kings of France and England at the time. Andrew II led the Fifth Crusade into the Middle East, raising a massive army. The Golden Bull of 1222, also issued by Andrew II, was the first constitutional document in continental Europe, being issued a mere seven years after the Magna Carta in England.</Text>

Over half of Hungary's two million residents fell victim to the Mongol hordes, while many refugees of those fleeing the invaders took residence in Hungary and were eventually absorbed into the population.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After the invasion ended, Bela IV ordered the construction of many fortifications and defenses, in order to better protect against further Mongol incursions. The Mongols did indeed return in the late 1200s, and their forces were repelled much easier.</Text>

			<Text>After a few chaotic decades in the wake of the Arpad dynasty, the Angevins took power, with Louis the Great as one of their most powerful. Louis led campaigns all over Europe and became king of Poland from 1370 onward. After he died without a male heir, the Hungarian throne was again thrown into turmoil. It was only stabilized after Sigismund of Luxembourg (related to the Arpads) ascended to the throne. In 1433, he became Holy Roman Emperor.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The last significantly powerful Hungarian king was Matthias Corvinus, who reigned at the dawn of the Renaissance.  He was the first king elected that was not part of the prior dynastic structure. He created the Bibliotecha Corviniana, the second-largest library in Europe at the time behind the Vatican library. His mercenary army, the Black Army, won many victories against other Europeans and the Ottomans. Hungary declined after his death without an heir, paving the way for increased Ottoman influence in the region.</Text>

			<Text>In the 16th century, the Ottomans finally overwhelmed the Kingdom of Hungary. The specific point at which this event occurred is often given as the 1526 Battle of Mohacs. The king, Louis II, died, and the nobility, in disarray, elected two kings simultaneously. Buda, the capital, was conquered in 1541.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Hungary was divided, with the east under direct Ottoman control or suzerainty, and the east under the control of the Habsburg dynasty. In 1686, the Holy League, a coalition of Christian nations, sent an army that retook Buda from the Ottomans. By 1718, the entire Kingdom of Hungary was removed from Ottoman rule. Hungary was devastated by this prolonged occupation and war.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the centuries after the Ottoman occupation, Hungary remained under the sway of the Habsburgs. Some politicians attempted to modernize, but this did not prove successful. Along with many other European nations, Hungary rebelled in 1848, against their Habsburg rulers. The rebels wanted a more democratic and more independent Hungary. The Habsburgs managed to subdue the revolution using populations from neighboring territories and eventually military conquest.</Text>

Hungarian elements in the Austro-Hungarian government attempted to prevent the outbreak of war, but they failed. Austria-Hungary was a large part of the Central Powers of World War I. The Empire drafted nine million soldiers, with four of those millions from Hungary. Hungarian troops specifically suffered more losses than any other part of the dual monarchy. While Serbia and Romania were captured, the Central Powers lost the war, and the Austro-Hungarian Empire was dissolved into its constituent nations.</Text>

			<Text>The Aster Revolution, in 1918, brought the socialist Mihaly Karolyi into power as Hungary's first president. The army was disbanded. Serbia, Romania, and Czechoslovakia took areas of Hungary which had majority ethnic populations, but also some of the Magyar areas. These annexations were not contested by the victorious Entente. A communist revolution occurred in 1919, but was put down by Romanian troops.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Treaty of Trianon, in 1920, took away 71% of its territory and two-thirds of its population. Many Hungarians became minorities in new countries. As a result, rightist forces took control of Hungary. During the Depression, autocratic and right-wing influences, including influence from Nazi Germany, drove Hungary in the direction of the Axis. The Germans and Italians granted Hungary part of the annexed Czechoslovakia in 1938. As 1939 progressed, Hungary began to reoccupy some of its former territories.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Hungarians only formally entered World War II on the side of the Axis in the wake of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa. They fought largely on the eastern front. In 1943, however, the Hungarians sought a surrender, as they had suffered great losses. In response, the Axis invaded and occupied Hungary, installing a puppet fascist regime. The country's economy was rededicated to the war effort. Eventually, the Soviets took Budapest after a two month long battle. After the war, Hungary returned to its pre-1938 borders.</Text>

For a brief time, Hungary withdrew from the Warsaw Pact, and Imre Nagy restored multiparty democracy. A month later, the Soviets intervened, killing tens of thousands and putting a stop to any reform. Janos Kadar was installed as the new leader. His more inclusive and less repressive attitude, combined with free-market reforms introduced as part of the New Economic Mechanism, led Hungary to have a higher standard of living and a more functional economy than many other Eastern Bloc states. Kadarwould rule until the peaceful fall of the People's Republic in 1989.</Text>

			<Text>Stephen I, also Saint Stephen, was the last Grand Prince of the Hungarians between 997 and 1000 or 1001, and the first King of Hungary from 1000 or 1001 until his death in 1038. He was born as Vajk in Esztergom. The year of his birth is uncertain, but many details of his life suggest that he was born in or after 975. He was the only son of Grand Prince Géza and his wife, Sarolt, who was descended from the prominent family of the gyulas. Although both of his parents were baptized, Stephen was the first member of his family to become a devout Christian. He married Gisela of Bavaria, a scion of the imperial Ottonian dynasty.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After succeeding his father in 997, Stephen had to fight for the throne against his relative, Koppány, who was supported by masses of pagan warriors. He defeated Koppány mainly with the assistance of Vecelin, Hont and Pázmány and other knights of foreign origin, but also with help from native lords. He was crowned on 25 December 1000 or 1 January 1001 with a crown sent by Pope Sylvester II. In a series of wars against semi-independent tribes and chieftains—including the Black Hungarians and his uncle, Gyula the Younger—he unified the Carpathian Basin. He protected the independence of his kingdom by forcing the invading troops of Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor to withdraw from Hungary in 1030.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Stephen established at least one archbishopric, six bishoprics and three Benedictine monasteries; thus the Church in Hungary developed independently of the archbishops of the Holy Roman Empire. He ensured the spread of Christianity among his subjects with severe punishments. His system of local administration was based on counties organized around fortresses and administered by royal officials. Hungary, which enjoyed a lasting period of peace during his reign, became a preferred route for pilgrims and merchants traveling between Western Europe and the Holy Land or Constantinople.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]He survived all of his children, which caused bitter conflicts among his relatives, lasting for decades. He died on 15 August 1038 and was buried in his new basilica, built in Székesfehérvár and dedicated to the Holy Virgin. Pope Gregory VII canonized him together with his son, Emeric, and Bishop Gerard of Csanád, in 1083. Stephen is a popular saint in Hungary and the neighboring territories. In Hungary, his feast day (celebrated on 20 August) is also a public holiday commemorating the foundation of the state.</Text>

			<Text>The word dragoon originally meant mounted infantry, who were trained in horse riding as well as infantry fighting skills. However, usage altered over time and during the 18th century, dragoons evolved into conventional light cavalry units and personnel. Dragoon regiments were established in most European armies during the late 17th and early 18th centuries.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The name is possibly derived from a type of firearm (called a dragon) carried by dragoons of the French Army. There is no distinction between the words dragon and dragoon in French; both are referred to as dragon.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The title has been retained in modern times by a number of armoured or ceremonial mounted regiments.</Text>
